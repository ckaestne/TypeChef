TypeChef
========

TypeChef is a research project with the goal of analyzing 
ifdef variability in C code with the goal of finding
variability-induced bugs in large-scale real-world systems,
such as the Linux kernel with several thousand 
features (or configuration options).

Instead of analyzing each variant for each feature 
combination in isolation, TypeChef parses the
entire source code containing all variability in a 
variability-aware fashion without preprocessing.
The resulting abstract syntax tree contains the 
variability in form of choice nodes. Eventually, a
variability-aware type system performs type checking 
on these trees, variability-aware data-flow analysis
performs data-flow analysis and so forth.

TypeChef was started with the goal of building a type
system for C code with compile-time configurations.
TypeChef was originally short for
*Type Checking Ifdef Variability*.
Over time it has grown into an infrastructure of all
kinds of analyses.
In all cases, the goal is to detect errors in all possible 
feature combinations, without resorting to a brute-force approach.

Architecture and Subprojects
----------------------------

The TypeChef project contains of four main components 
and several helper libraries.

* A library for reasoning about **feature expressions** (subproject *FeatureExprLib*). 
  The library allows to easily express and reason about expressions
  in propositional logic. It supports also parsing feature expressions
  and loading entire feature models (in textual format or a .dimacs file).
  For reasoning, internally both BDDs and SAT solvers are used which
  allows to scale reasoning even to feature models the size of the Linux kernel.
  The library can be (and is) reused in very different contexts also in Java code.

* A library of **conditional data structures** for variational programming 
  (subproject *ConditionalLib*) with several useful operations on
  conditional structures. Used heavily in all other subprojects.
  For a short introduction see [VariationalProgramming.md](https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef/blob/XtcIntegration/VariationalProgramming.md).

* A **variability-aware lexer** (also called partial preprocessor;
  subproject *PartialPreprocessor*) that
  reads unpreprocessed code and produces a conditional 
  token stream. The variability-aware lexer is responsible
  for resolving macros and file inclusions and for 
  normalizing `#ifdef` conditions

* A **variability-aware parser framework** provides 
  parser combinators to build variability-aware parsers
  (subproject *ParserFramework*).

* The **variability-aware parsers** for GNU C and Java 
  (subprojects *CParser* and *JavaParser*) use the parser
  framework to build parsers for the corresponding languages. 
  The parsers read a conditional token stream and
  produce abstract syntax trees with corresponding choice nodes.

* A **variability-aware type system** (subproject *CTypeChecker*)
  eventually checks variability in the abstract
  syntax tree. This will be supported by variability-aware 
  linker checks.

* A **variability-aware control-flow and data-flow analysis**
  (subproject *CRewrite*) provides implementations for
  successor/predecessor determination of abstract syntax tree
  elements in the presence of choice nodes and on top of it
  a variable liveness implementation. 

* Setups for analyzing individual systems together with useful tooling  are available as
  separate github projects (see section evaluation below).



Installation and Usage
----------------------

For simple experimentation, try our [online version](http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~kaestner/TypeChef/online/).

Alternatively, you can download a .jar file including
all necessary libraries [TypeChef.jar](http://ckaestne.github.io/TypeChef/deploy/TypeChef-0.3.4.jar). Run as usual

    java -jar TypeChef.jar ...

TypeChef is also available as a [maven repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctypechef).
With [sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) you can include TypeChef with the following line:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "de.fosd.typechef" %% "frontend" % "0.3.4"
```

To build TypeChef from source, we use 
[sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/). 
Install *git* and download and compile the code as follows

    git clone git://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef.git
    cd TypeChef
    java -Xmx512M -Xss10m -jar sbt-launch.jar clean update compile

Due to library dependencies, setting up the TypeChef classpath
can be difficult. There are two convenient mechanisms:
Use `sbt assembly` to build a single jar file.
Alternatively, call `sbt mkrun` to create a script 
`typechef.sh` that sets a correct classpath. 

Most functionality of TypeChef is accessible through parameters of
the main `de.fosd.typechef.Frontend` class. Call TypeChef with `--help` to see a 
list of configuration parameters. See also 
[Parameter.txt]( https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef/blob/master/Parameter.txt).
You will need to set up system include paths with `-I` and
a header file with the compiler's macro definitions with `-h` (generate, 
for example, with `echo - | gcc -dM - -E -std=gnu99` for gcc).
Have a look at existing projects using TypeChef or contact us in
case of questions.

IntelliJ Idea users should run `sbt gen-idea` to create 
corresponding project and classpath information for the 
IDE. Similar sbt plugins for Eclipse are available, 
but we have not tried or integrated them yet. In general 
avoid to set the classpath in IDEs manually, but let sbt 
generate corresponding files for you.

Evaluation
----------

Details on our syntax analysis of Linux have been published 
in an OOPSLA paper (see below).
You find additional information on that evaluation at 
[http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~kaestner/TypeChef/](http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~kaestner/TypeChef/)

Details of the type checking and linker checking of Busybox were
publishing in an subsequent OOPSLA paper (see below).

The implementation of the data-flow analysis has been evaluated in two case studies (BusyBox and Linux) and the result of this evaluation is available from http://fosd.net/vaa

The setups for running TypeChef on these projects are available
as separate github projects, for example:

 * https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef-LinuxAnalysis
 * https://github.com/ckaestne/TypeChef-BusyboxAnalysis

The variability-aware lexer is implemented on top of [jcpp](http://www.anarres.org/projects/jcpp/), an implementation of the
C preprocessor in Java. An alternative based on [xtc/superc](http://cs.nyu.edu/xtc/) is included experimentally as well.

For reasoning about propositional formulas, we use the SAT solver [sat4j](http://www.sat4j.org/).

The GNU C parser is based on an [ANTLR grammar for GNU C](http://www.antlr.org/grammar/cgram).

The Java parser is based on a grammar that can be traced back to the Java 1.5 grammar in the
[JavaCC repository](http://java.net/projects/javacc/downloads/directory/contrib/grammars).

Experimentally, the [Xtc/SuperC](https://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/) parser is included as .jar file to provide an alternative lexer.

For convenience, we include a binary of [sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) in the repository.

This work was supported in part by the European Research Council, grant #203099.
